As of 15/12/23, the purpose of this github is to document my progress as I attempt to find the most suitable Machine Learning model for my low performance laptop. 
The codes do not represent my project as a whole, but rather only the Machine Learning part.
The other parts of the code, such as the GUI and the Google API, are being put on hold until I find the suitable Machine Learning model.
(P.S. If you're wondering why I've only started searching for alternative Machine Learning models, it's because I always thought it was the size of the question and answers files that were bogging down my code. 
      only until I left about 20000 rows in the excel files (around 1% of the original gigantic file size) did I realize that the issue now had to be the laptop's CPU and the Machine Learning model I was using at the time.)
Any queries, and you can email me at: 17mostef@student.st-ignatius.enfield.sch.uk, or just send a private message.
